# Content Outline (Structure)

## Potential Pages
> *Italic Points* are ideas for pages which are non-essential to the website's functionality.

- ~Home Page~ - Should contain a **brief** description of the society and its aims (welcoming to beginners etc.). Maybe include some of the positive reviews
  from Facebook? Important to **not** overload this page with text.
  
- About Page - Contains more detailed information about the society along with maybe some past projects (like the flappy bird game). Maybe
also some information on the commitee.

- *Challenge Page* - A page which has programming challenges to solve. Should probably be split into *beginner*, *intermediate* and *advanced*.
  Updated each fortnight and correct solutions' authors are put up on a 'Wall of Fame' on this page. Possibly give small prizes for best/quickest
  solutions if participant is member to incentivize membership - to be discussed.
  
- Membership Page - A page where prospective parties can learn about and sign up to the mailing list. After this inital sign-up, it can prompt them to go to
  [EUSA](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/societies/society/17825/) to buy membership.
  
- *News/Events Page* - Updated periodically to reflect upcoming events and/or interesting news e.g. Hello World Hack.

- *FAQ Page* - A page to answer all the common questions newcomers have.

- ~Sponsor Us~ - Info about sponsorship

- ~404~ - that
